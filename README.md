Overall Approach and Methodology

  Initialization:
  Initialized the RestaurantScraper class with a location to search.
  Defined the output file name based on the location.
  
  Scrolling:
  Used the slow_scroll_to_bottom method to gradually scroll to the bottom of the page, allowing time for content to load.
  
  Scraping Data:
  Extracted restaurant data after scrolling to the end of the page.
  Monitored network requests to ensure data is loaded.
  Extracted relevant information for each restaurant, including ID, name, location, cuisine, delivery time, etc.
  Calculated the estimated delivery fee based on the distance from the delivery location.
  
  Saving Data:
  Saved the extracted data as JSON objects to an NDJSON file.
  
  Parallel Execution:
  Used a process pool to run scraping tasks for multiple locations in parallel.

Challenges Faced:

  SSL Verification:
  Had to disable web security and handle SSL verification issues.
  
  Network Monitoring:
  Needed to monitor network requests to ensure data was loaded before scraping.
  
  Data Extraction:
  Required extracting data from nested JSON structures.
  
  Scalability:
  Ensuring the script can handle a large number of locations efficiently.

Improvements and Optimizations:

  Error Handling:
  Implemented error handling to manage cases where no restaurants are found for a location.
  
  Quality Control Checks:
  Implemented quality control checks to ensure data integrity, completeness, and accuracy.
  
  Optimized Scrolling:
  Implemented a efficient scrolling mechanism to improve performance.
  
  Data Parsing:
  Used more robust methods for extracting data from nested JSON structures.
  
  Parallel Processing:
  Optimized parallel processing to handle a larger number of locations more efficiently.
  
  User Interaction:
  Add user interaction for inputting locations or selecting locations from a list.
  
  Logging and Reporting:
  Implemented reporting to track the scraping process and any errors encountered.
  
  Code Refactoring:
  Refactored code to improve readability, maintainability, and reusability.
